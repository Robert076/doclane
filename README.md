# Selfconta

**Selfconta** is a document workflow platform designed to simplify the
relationship between accountants and their clients.

It enables accountants to request documents (one-time or recurring),
while clients upload exactly what is needed, on time, in a clear and
structured way.

Selfconta focuses on reducing communication friction, eliminating
document chaos, and creating a better experience for both sides.

## 🎯 Problem

Accountants and small businesses typically exchange documents through
email, messaging apps, or shared folders.

This leads to:
- lost or duplicated documents
- constant follow-ups
- lack of visibility on what is missing
- wasted time and unnecessary stress

---

## ✅ Solution

Selfconta provides a single, structured portal where:

- Accountants create clients and define required documents
- Document requests can be one-time or recurring (e.g. monthly)
- Clients upload files directly to each request
- Both sides see clear status: missing, uploaded, overdue

Selfconta is **not** accounting software.
It is a workflow and document request system.
