# Doclane

**Doclane** is a document request and workflow platform designed to help
professionals collect documents from their clients in a clear,
structured, and reliable way.

It enables teams to request documents (one-time or recurring), while
clients upload exactly what is needed, on time, through a simple and
secure portal.

Doclane focuses on eliminating document chaos, reducing follow-ups, and
creating a smooth experience for both professionals and their clients.

## 🎯 Problem

Professionals and their clients often exchange documents via email,
messaging apps, or shared folders.

This results in:
- lost or duplicated files
- constant follow-ups and reminders
- lack of visibility into what is missing or overdue
- wasted time and unnecessary friction

---

## ✅ Solution

Doclane provides a single, structured workspace where:

- Professionals create clients and define required documents
- Document requests can be one-time or recurring (e.g. monthly)
- Clients upload files directly to each request
- Both sides see clear request status: missing, uploaded, overdue

Doclane is **not** a document storage service.
It is a document request and workflow platform.

required.
